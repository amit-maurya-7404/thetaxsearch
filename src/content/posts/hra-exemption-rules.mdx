# Complete Guide to HRA Exemption Rules

HRA (House Rent Allowance) is one of the most popular tax deductions available to salaried employees. Let's understand the rules and how to maximize your benefits.

## What is HRA?

HRA is a component of salary paid to employees who rent their residence. It's paid in addition to basic salary to help cover housing costs.

## HRA Exemption Formula

The exempt amount is the **least of** the following three amounts:

### 1. Actual HRA Received
The HRA component mentioned in your salary slip.

### 2. Percentage of Basic Salary
- **Metro Cities**: 50% of basic salary
- **Tier-1 Cities**: 40% of basic salary
- **Other Cities**: 25% of basic salary

### 3. Actual Rent Paid - 10% of Basic Salary
The actual rent paid (to a landlord) minus 10% of your basic salary.

## Example Calculation

**Details**:
- Basic Salary: ₹50,000/month
- HRA Received: ₹20,000/month
- Rent Paid: ₹18,000/month
- City: Delhi (Metro)

**Calculation**:
- Actual HRA: ₹20,000
- 50% of Basic (Metro): ₹25,000
- Rent - 10% of Basic: ₹18,000 - ₹5,000 = ₹13,000

**Exempt HRA = Least of (20,000, 25,000, 13,000) = ₹13,000**

## Who is Eligible?

- ✅ Salaried employees
- ✅ Renting a house
- ✅ Has HRA component in salary
- ✅ Has valid rent receipts
- ✅ Landlord details available

### Not Eligible:
- ❌ Own house residents
- ❌ No HRA in salary
- ❌ No rent receipts
- ❌ Living in company accommodation

## Documentation Required

1. **Rent Receipt/Agreement**
   - Landlord's name and address
   - Monthly rent amount
   - Period of rent paid

2. **Landlord's Details**
   - PAN or Aadhar
   - Signature on agreement

3. **Self-Declaration**
   - Confirmation of renting
   - Period of residence

4. **Bank Statements**
   - Evidence of rent payments

## Special Cases

### Living with Parents/Relatives
- If no rent is paid: No HRA exemption
- If rent is paid: You can claim exemption
- Need to provide rent receipt and landlord details

### Multiple Locations
- Claim exemption only for primary residence
- If transferred during year: Pro-rata exemption
- Need to provide rent details for each location

### Annual vs Monthly Rent

The exemption is calculated on monthly basis but applied annually:
- **Annual Exemption** = Monthly Exemption × 12

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **No Documentation**: Always maintain rent receipts
❌ **Wrong Landlord Details**: Use correct name and PAN
❌ **Claiming Without Rent**: Must actually pay rent
❌ **Not Updating Address**: Inform employer about address changes
❌ **Black Money**: Always use legitimate rent payments

## Tax Benefits

If exempt HRA amount is ₹13,000/month:
- Annual exemption: ₹1,56,000
- Tax saving (at 30% slab): ₹46,800
- Tax saving (at 20% slab): ₹31,200
