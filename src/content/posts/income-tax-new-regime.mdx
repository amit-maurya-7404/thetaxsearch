## Who Should Choose Which?

### Choose New Regime If:

- You are a young professional with no investments
- You have no HRA or professional expenses

### Choose Old Regime If:
- You maximize Section 80C investments
- You have HRA components
- You have significant professional deductions
- You want maximum tax benefits

## How to Decide?

1. Calculate your tax under both regimes
2. Consider your available deductions
3. Review your investment plans
4. Consult a tax advisor
5. Choose the option giving lower tax

## Important Notes

- You can switch regimes (within limits)
- Once you opt for new regime, you must continue for at least 4 years
- Both regimes have standard deduction of ₹50,000
- The option must be exercised while filing return

## Conclusion

The best regime depends on your personal situation. Generally, if you can utilize more than ₹50,000 in deductions, the old regime is beneficial. Calculate your tax liability in both scenarios to make an informed decision.

**Pro Tip**: Consult with a tax professional to optimize your tax liability based on your specific circumstances.
